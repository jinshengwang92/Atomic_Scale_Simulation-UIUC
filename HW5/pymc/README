run `python main.py --help` to see how to use this code

output:
usage: main.py [-h] [-t TEMPERATURE] [-sig SIGMA] [-n NSWEEPS] [-s SEED] [-r]

molecular dynamics of Lennard-Jones fluid with 64 particles with mass 48.0 in
a cubic box of length 4.0 using a timestep of 0.032

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -t TEMPERATURE, --temperature TEMPERATURE
                        temperature in reduced units, reasonable range 0.5 -
                        4.0
  -sig SIGMA, --sigma SIGMA
                        random walk step size
  -n NSWEEPS, --nsweeps NSWEEPS
                        number of simulation steps
  -s SEED, --seed SEED  random number generator seed
  -r, --restart         restart simulation from trajectory file, default to
                        traj.xyz
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Default parameters are consistent with those stated on the HW page. The program will output a few files:
scalar.dat: trace of potential energy, dumped every sweep
gofr.dat: trace of pair correlation, averaged internally and dumped every naccum=5 sweeps.
sofk.dat: trace of structure factor, averaged internally and dumped every naccum=5 sweeps.
traj.dat: trace of particle positions, can be used for visualization and restart, dumped every ndump=10 sweeps

The first line of gofr.dat contains the bin centers (r)
The first line of sofk.dat contains the magnitude of the k vectors (k)

see HW3 phase transition example code for how to plot gofr.dat and sofk.dat
to visualize the MC samples, `source Visualize.tcl` in the Tk console of VMD

For production runs:
  1. be sure to pass in -n 2000 to make long runs
  2. if you decide to make many short runs with restart, be sure to change the random seed with -s [a different number every run]
